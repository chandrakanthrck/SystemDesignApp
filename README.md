## Overview

System Design App is an educational tool built with React to help developers and students understand key system design concepts. It includes interactive examples and visual aids that explain topics such as:

- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Caching and Distributed Caching
- Latency vs. Throughput
- CAP Theorem
- Load Balancing
- Microservices Architecture
- Strong vs. Eventual Consistency
- REST vs. RPC
- Batch Processing vs. Stream Processing
- And many more!

## Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Each system design concept comes with visual diagrams to make learning more engaging.
- **Animations with Framer Motion**: Concepts are presented with smooth animations to make the app more intuitive.
- **Easy Navigation**: A user-friendly navigation bar makes it easy to explore different topics.
- **React Router Integration**: Supports different routes for each concept.
- **Modular Codebase**: Well-organized code that follows React best practices.
